    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of our integrations section which shows you how to quickly get started with different LLM integrations. In this notebook, we will use LaVague with Groq's Language Processing Unit (LPU) via the Groq API. The default model used is `llama3-70b-8192`, but you can also choose from other models such as `llama3-8b-8192`, `llama2-70b-4096`, `mixtral-8x7b-32768`, and `gemma-7b-it` by specifying the desired model in the configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of the Groq API is its ability to process up to 300 tokens per second per user using Groq's Language Processing Unit (LPU). This is at least 3 times and up to 18 times faster than traditional cloud-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-requisites:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- For our integration notebooks, we assume you have already downloaded the necessary webdriver folders and moved them to your root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For our integration notebooks, we assume you have already downloaded and installed the latest `lavague` package from the `main` of our GitHub repo. For more information on installation - see our [installation guide](../../get-started/setting-up-la-vague) or our [quick tour notebook](../../get-started/quick-tour)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are running the notebook locally, you will need Python (tested on python>=3.8) and pip installed."
